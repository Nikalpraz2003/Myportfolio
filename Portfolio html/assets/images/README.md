# Profile Images

## How to add your profile photo:

1. Add your profile photo to this folder and name it `profile.jpg` (or `profile.png`)
2. Recommended dimensions: 400x400 pixels (square)
3. The image will automatically display in the header with a gradient border

## Supported formats:
- JPG/JPEG
- PNG
- WebP

**Note:** If no image is found, the header will automatically fall back to showing your initials "NP" with a gradient background.
